## Hey there! ðŸ‘‹

I'm Jake, a passionate software developer and CompSci graduate based in Manchester. Welcome to my GitHub profile!

### What I'm all about

I thrive on turning complex problems into elegant solutions through code. With a strong foundation in computer science and a curious mindset, I'm constantly exploring new technologies and learning innovative ways to build efficient and user-friendly software.

### My favourite languages

I have a diverse language palette, which allows me to approach projects from various angles. Here are some languages that I particularly enjoy working with:
- Kotlin: I fell in love with Kotlin during my university studies and have since leveraged its concise syntax and powerful features to build robust Android applications.
- Swift: As an enthusiast of iOS development, I'm proficient in Swift and have developed sleek and user-friendly mobile apps for the Apple ecosystem.
- C#: With a solid foundation in C#, I've developed a deep understanding of the .NET ecosystem, allowing me to create scalable and performant applications for web and desktop.
- JavaScript: Being well-versed in JavaScript enables me to craft interactive and dynamic web experiences, leveraging frameworks like React and Vue.js to build modern front-end interfaces.
- HTML, CSS, and PHP: I have hands-on experience in web development, utilizing HTML and CSS to create engaging user interfaces, and PHP to enhance server-side functionality.
- Python: I have worked with Python for web app backend development and dabbled in machine learning projects. Its simplicity and vast ecosystem make it a versatile language for a wide range of applications.
- Java and C++: These were my trusted companions during my university years, where I delved into object-oriented programming and learned the fundamentals of software development.
